I also decided to add items to my character that aren't realistic, such a duck beak and a party hat. Neither of these are things i have lol but I feel like it still speaks to my gender identity.

Windows PC.,He/Him,"I’m autistic, and have been playing DnD for 15 years and am really into BG3 (special interest), I also love how diverse and safe the character creation is!! You can pick genitals, pronouns, voices, and more! It’s super inclusive (compared to other stuff)!","Before I came out as a trans man, I always found myself wanting to play “the boy character”. When I first found games that I could create my own characters, I always created characters who just looked like a “boy version” of me at the time, and I’d feel very happy playing the games. As I’ve started transitioning, and still suffer from dysphoria (but more body dysmorphia now that I’ve gotten top surgery), I get to make characters that may not look like me, but are still men that I find cool, aesthetically appealing, or attractive. In BG3 you can also choose genitals like I said, and romance characters, and as a gay trans man, I enjoyed being able to play a male character with female genitalia and romance a cis man - it made me feel less uncomfortable about navigating the dating field and always feeling unseen. I love the BG3 character customization (I think it has some places it could improve - like adding plus-sized characters, etc), and it just makes me happy to know that I can play a cis man, trans man, cis woman, trans woman, or even a nonbinary character! Character creation allowed me to explore my gender before coming out, and now that I have it allows me to affirm that gender identity and (in Baldur’s Gate’s case) allows me to also affirm my sexuality!",Screenshot,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/170014075_eillurdekarios_avatar/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/simple/170014075_eillurdekarios_avatar/fullwidth.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/170014075_eillurdekarios_avatar/manifest.json,12,submissionimg_item,submissionimg,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/170014075_eillurdekarios_avatar/full/1140,/0/default.jpg"

I gave them no visible genitals or nipples similar to my own transition goals but I would've preferred to not have a chest. I'm actually getting top surgery in real life next year. Also their hair is purple and in space buns which is my favorite color/style but I prefer my hair shorter and more androgynous in real life.

197544277_quail_avatar,Quail's Submission,Quail,She/Her. They/Them. He/Him,Baldur's Gate III. Larian Studios. 2023. Windows PC.,He/Him,"There are admittedly not many games with diverse character creation available. My other choices were Cyberpunk 2077 (which doesn't have a nonbinary option and has streamlined romance options based on your combination of sex and gender) and Mass Effect (which forces you into a binary with less freedom with character design- which I don't blame considering how old it is). Baldur's Gate 3 made me feel able to make my character my own. I could give them any voice, body type, and genitals without feeling forced by the game to make certain choices, especially when it came to romance.","My gender identity is up in the air. Mostly, I feel Agender and don't necessarily care how I'm addressed. Sometimes I feel nonbinary and would prefer to be addressed as they/them. However, I don't feel comfortable expressing my preferred identity in real life, so just default to my birth sex since that's easier. In video games, however, I can become whoever I want. Since I prefer single player games, I especially feel able to be myself without judgement. The characters I make tend to have a mixture of feminine and masculine traits, which is usually only possible with diverse character creators. The character I submitted is male with a masculine voice, but has a more feminine body. It's similar to how I myself am female in body, but don't particularly mentally connect with being a woman. Character creators have allowed me to explore how I see myself and how I want to be seen by others. Some of the first character creators I encountered were in text-based interactive fiction games (e.g. Choice of Games LLC) where there are no visuals, you just state your gender and appearance. Going from that form of mentally envisioning my character to games like Baldur's Gate 3 that let me physically see them has helped me feel more comfortable with myself. Even if the world would find me strange, I have a sense of internal acceptance where I know it's okay to not fit into what someone expects of me.",Screenshot,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/197544277_quail_avatar/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/simple/197544277_quail_avatar/fullwidth.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/197544277_quail_avatar/manifest.json,17,submissionimg_item,submissionimg,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/197544277_quail_avatar/full/1140,/0/default.jpg"
198417095_Crash_avatar,Crash's Submission,Crash,Any Pronouns,Stardew Valley. Designed by Eric Barone. ConcernedApe. 2016. PlayStation 4.,She/Her,Stardew Valley is the video game I've played the most (that also has a character customizer). I've been playing it on and off since the pandemic and it's provided me a lot of comfort.,"The nice thing about single-player games is that you can literally make your character look however, and everyone in the game still treats you the same. This allows room for exploration -- my first two SV characters were versions of myself, but in this third world I'm a woman farmer who also happens to have a beard. (Her name is Griselda.) Stardew Valley is also one of those games where the movement of just a few pixels can entirely change how your character looks, and it's not as if the base characters are highly gendered anyway. (You do pick male/female in the character creation screen, but that only affects the pronouns NPCs call you.)",Screenshot,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/198417095_Crash_avatar/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/simple/198417095_Crash_avatar/fullwidth.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/198417095_Crash_avatar/manifest.json,18,submissionimg_item,submissionimg,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/198417095_Crash_avatar/full/1140,/0/default.jpg"
200052971_bungus_avatar,Bungus' Submission,Bungus,He/Him,Space Station 14. Space Wizards Foundation. 2024. Windows PC.,He/Him,It's a multiplayer roleplaying game and I find it a lot of fun.,"For RP games, I don't feel like my characters need to reflect my own gender identity since I'm doing a bit; but I still end up usually playing guys and/or gender diverse characters in some form. Before figuring myself out, I would often try playing as a girl (either because there was more customization available or I felt it was what I 'had to do' because I was stuck being one IRL.) Later on as my egg cracked I started playing guys in character-creator games more, and that is what I usually do now. I'll play as a guy if it's representing me, and if it's a separate character they're likely still masculine. I think making chars. in singleplayer games (and in general through RP/etc) lets you explore aspects of yourself or things like that that you don't get to (or shouldn't) do in real life (like making an evil char etc), but also often reflects a bit of yourself in them. Since all gender is a sort of performance, having a character perform it in a game definitely lets you explore stuff.",Screenshot,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/200052971_bungus_avatar/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/simple/200052971_bungus_avatar/fullwidth.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/200052971_bungus_avatar/manifest.json,19,submissionimg_item,submissionimg,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/200052971_bungus_avatar/full/1140,/0/default.jpg"
168696082_soren_avatar,Soren's Submission,Soren,He/Him,Baldur's Gate III. Larian Studios. 2023. Windows PC.,They/Them,"BG3 is one of my favorite games to create characters in because the character creator has so many options, and the character you're playing directly impacts story choices and game-play. When I first started playing the game, I restarted multiple times just to make new characters and see what changed in-game based on that. It also helps that BG3 has a lot of options for gender expression in terms of voice, body type, genitals, and more. Over time, I have played many different characters with different gender expressions.","Character creation for me has been both a way to express my own gender identity and a way to explore other gender expressions, even if they aren't what I strictly identify with. Though I personally identify as transmasc and use he/him pronouns, my characters in BG3 usually fall into she/they, he/they, and they/them territory with any combination of masculine and feminine features. I think the only common trait shared by my BG3 characters is that none of them really conform to a binary gender. Since the game lets you mix and match physical characteristics, voice types, and clothes, I don't think I have made any characters that could be identified as a cisgender man or woman. Essentially, there's always some kind of gender fuckery going on. Perhaps this is a reflection of my own personal resistance to identify with a binary gender. In other games that don't have the same level of customization, I usually create masculine female characters or feminine male characters based on clothing options/names. I just think playing gender-non-conforming characters is neat.",Screenshot,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/168696082_soren_avatar/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/simple/168696082_soren_avatar/fullwidth.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/168696082_soren_avatar/manifest.json,2,submissionimg_item,submissionimg,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/168696082_soren_avatar/full/1140,/0/default.jpg"

It's a game that encourages you to play as yourself and identify with your character. In other single-player games with character creators that I play, like Stardew Valley or No Man's Sky (both of those have multiplayer modes but I play them in singleplayer), I do usually make characters with the same gender identity as myself (male), and with styles that I find appealing, but they are other people and I give them different names and motivations. I use them to explore gender as well, but in more of a fantasy context (I can be a badass masculine fighter in those games, or an angel with wings, or I particularly like playing No Man's Sky as a Construct who has to build himself from scratch as an allegory for building my own life as a trans person), whereas I keep my Animal Crossing outfits realistic to things I might actually wear.",Screenshot,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/168770509_marsupial_avatar/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/simple/168770509_marsupial_avatar/fullwidth.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/168770509_marsupial_avatar/manifest.json,4,submissionimg_item,submissionimg,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/168770509_marsupial_avatar/full/1140,/0/default.jpg"

Normally I choose games with a pre-established player character, because I'd rather play 'someone else's story' than my own.","When I played games pre-transition, picking the gender of your character was automatically assumed to be your gender. When I played online, people assumed me to be male. I wasn't allowed to express myself offline, but online I didn't even have to express. I didn't have to tell someone my pronouns and hope it would be respected. I didn't have to fumble through explanations of transness. I just got to be a guy, playing with a bunch of other guys. Hearing people in voice chat call me by he/him pronouns automatically was very comforting. It was also interesting to play around with clothing options. NFS:Heat doesn't restrict clothes to gender. Male characters can wear crop tops. Female characters can wear baggy jeans. When creating my character at first, I tried many combinations of clothing and character models.
