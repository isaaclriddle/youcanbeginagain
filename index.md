In a world hostile to those living outside the gender binary, transgender people are faced with an overwhelming pressure to conform to a performance of gender aligned with assigned sex. Searching for an outlet, many trans people find themselves drawn to online environments as a form of escape from the threat of transphobic vitriol and gender-policing in the real world. Video games, then, become critical avenues of research for the ways in which they can assist in the exploration of gender identity.

This archival project operates under the theoretical umbrellas of queer theory, video game studies, and trans studies to analyze the ways in which gender identity development and exploration interact with the ludic (gameplay) elements of single-player video games. Through an intermingling of Judith Butler’s idea of performative gender in *Gender Trouble*, Sarah Ahmend's *Queer Phenomenology,* and Uri Miller's *Embodied Avatars,* this project understands the act of playing video games with a self-made avatar as a co-creationary performance of the self, in which trans gamers utilize their player characters to begin again. The collection of avatars and stories contained within demonstrate the ways in which trans people play with gender. <- edit this
