These terms, as defined within the context of the archive, establish a foundation for the ways in which certain concepts and ideas for transgender, gender-questioning, and gender-diverse individuals are understood in this digital archive. They also define key video game terminology and the general concept of performance.

**Gender and Identity:**

Gender Identity: a person’s internal sense of their gender (or lack thereof), which may or may not align with their sex coercively assigned at birth.

Transgender: a person who does not identify as the sex that they were coercively assigned at birth. This person may or may not be intersex.

Gender-Diverse: an umbrella label that encompasses transgender, intersex, and gender-questioning individuals. It also includes Indigenous-specific gender identities.

Gender-Questioning: a person who is questioning or otherwise unsure of whether or not they identify with the sex that they were coercively assigned at birth.

Gender Exploration: the process of learning about your gender identity through things including but not limited to appearance, presentation (in real life or online), “trying out” societal norms and visual indicators of gender and sex, etc. This is a process of self-discovery, and is not limited solely to those who are gender-questioning, transgender, or gender-diverse.

**Video Games and Performance:**

Role-Playing Games: games, both digital and physical, that involve a player or a group of players pretending to be characters that they are not in a fictional setting and storyline. Popular examples include the tabletop (non-digital) roleplaying game, made by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, *Dungeons and Dragons*, or the video game *Fallout: New Vegas,* developed by Obsidian Entertainment.

Single-Player Games: games that are played offline, where only one individual player is able to interact with, change, and "play" the game. The challenges faced by the player are generated by computer-controlled plot points, world-building, characters, and enemies. They are often more centered around story. These types of games include, but are not limited to, role-playing games.

Multi-Player Games: games that are played with others, either online or alongside them in the same room, where multiple players are able to interact with, change, and "play" the game. This genre of video game typically incorporates some kind of competitive and/or interpersonal element. This can include, for example, players working together to develop the same farm in *Stardew Valley,* developed by ConcernedApe, or players tasked with defeating other players on an enemy team in *Overwatch,* developed by Blizzard Entertainment.

Ludology: the study of playing games. Within the context of video game studies, this involves an analysis of gameplay systems that allow players to engage and interact with the games themselves; it's how players "play."

Performance: an act of embodiment or otherwise staging, acting-out, and accomplishing (or attempting to accomplish) a concept, ideal, story, or belief through socio-cultural, presentational, and interpersonal methods. This "acting-out" is, usually, engaged with and moderated by a larger audience, but in the context of the single-player video game, it is not.
