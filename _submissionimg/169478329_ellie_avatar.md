why_this_game: '"Not many games that I play have that level of customization, so this
  is the most recent game I could develop a character I identify better with (she''s
  an elf, so it''s not really me, but that fits the fantasy element)."'
avatar_relationship: '"I love being able to create a character that is closer to how
  I''d like to see myself. No level of real life can match the way I see myself. It''s
  great to be able to play with my own self image and see what ''fits'' me. (There
  is another model I have for VR Chat which has a different quality, but I wasn''t
  sure if that qualifies for a game, plus it''s a model I''m worknig on, so I can''t
  get an in-game screenshot yet.)"'
