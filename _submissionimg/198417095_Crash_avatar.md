game: Stardew Valley. Designed by Eric Barone. ConcernedApe. 2016. PlayStation 4.
why_this_game: '"Stardew Valley is the video game I''ve played the most (that also
  has a character customizer). I''ve been playing it on and off since the pandemic
  and it''s provided me a lot of comfort."'
avatar_relationship: '"The nice thing about single-player games is that you can literally
  make your character look however, and everyone in the game still treats you the
  same. This allows room for exploration -- my first two SV characters were versions
  of myself, but in this third world I''m a woman farmer who also happens to have
  a beard. (Her name is Griselda.) Stardew Valley is also one of those games where
  the movement of just a few pixels can entirely change how your character looks,
  and it''s not as if the base characters are highly gendered anyway. (You do pick
  male/female in the character creation screen, but that only affects the pronouns
  NPCs call you.)"'
alt_text: '"This avatar is in a pixelated style, and has red eyes, pale skin, short
  black hair, and a thick black beard. She is wearing a light brown cowboy hat, a
  blue button-up, black pants, and dark purple boots."'
