why_this_game: '"Stardew Valley is the video game I''ve played the most (that also
  has a character customizer). I''ve been playing it on and off since the pandemic
  and it''s provided me a lot of comfort."'
avatar_relationship: ' "The nice thing about single-player games is that you can literally
  make your character look however, and everyone in the game still treats you the
  same. This allows room for exploration -- my first two SV characters were versions
  of myself, but in this third world I am a woman farmer who also happens to have a
  beard. (Her name is Griselda.) Stardew Valley is also one of those games where the
  movement of just a few pixels can entirely change how your character looks, and
  it is not as if the base characters are highly gendered anyway. (You do pick male/female
  in the character creation screen, but that only affects the pronouns NPCs call you.)" '
