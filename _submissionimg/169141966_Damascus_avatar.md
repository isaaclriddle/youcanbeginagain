avatar_pronouns: He/Him
why_this_game: '"It''s the only game that I have a custom character in. Normally I
  choose games with a pre-established player character, because I''d rather play ''someone
  else''s story'' than my own."'
avatar_relationship: '"When I played games pre-transition, picking the gender of your
  character was automatically assumed to be your gender. When I played online, people
  assumed me to be male. I wasn''t allowed to express myself offline, but online I
  didn''t even have to express. I didn''t have to tell someone my pronouns and hope
  it would be respected. I didn''t have to fumble through explanations of transness.
  I just got to be a guy, playing with a bunch of other guys. Hearing people in voice
  chat call me by he/him pronouns automatically was very comforting. It was also interesting
  to play around with clothing options. NFS:Heat doesn''t restrict clothes to gender.
  Male characters can wear crop tops. Female characters can wear baggy jeans. When
  creating my character at first, I tried many combinations of clothing and character
  models. It helped me understand that my identity, expression, and body transition
  goals are all explicitly masculine (as opposed to some transmasculine people who
  may feel more comfortable with feminine expression when their identities are affirmed)."'
