why_this_game: '"I picked that one of 9 characters I have cosmetics for because I
  think it best encapsulates the general theme of the cosmetic loadout I made which
  is wintry! Pyro has that cute little face mask + the sweater it all comes together
  nicely."'
avatar_relationship: '"I could imagine the subconscious visual choices and clothing
  items could reflect my own desires and wants for my appearance or outward identity,
  and sort in that way is both a goalline and a source of projection."'
alt_text: '"This avatar is of a larger build in a burnt-orange jumpsuit with explosives
  strapped to their chest. Their face is obscured by a gask mask with black filters
  over the mouth, on one side of the face, and over the eyes. On top of the mask,
  they have an orange beanie with a white bauble. They are holding a large black flamethrower
  with the fuel tank strapped to their back."'
