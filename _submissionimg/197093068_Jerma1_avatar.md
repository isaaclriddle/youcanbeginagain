why_this_game: '"I picked that one of 9 characters I have cosmetics for because I
  think it best encapsulates the general theme of the cosmetic loadout I made which
  is wintry! Pyro has that cute little face mask + the sweater it all comes together
  nicely."'
avatar_relationship: '"I could imagine the subconscious visual choices and clothing
  items could reflect my own desires and wants for my appearance or outward identity,
  and sort in that way is both a goalline and a source of projection."'
