why_this_game: '"I''m autistic, and have been playing DnD for 15 years and am really
  into BG3 (special interest), I also love how diverse and safe the character creation
  is!! You can pick genitals, pronouns, voices, and more! It''s super inclusive (compared
  to other stuff)!"'
avatar_relationship: "\"Before I came out as a trans man, I always found myself wanting
  to play 'the boy character'. When I first found games that I could create my own
  characters, I always created characters who just looked like a “boy version? of
  me at the time, and I'd feel very happy playing the games. As I've started transitioning,
  and still suffer from dysphoria (but more body dysmorphia now that I've gotten top
  surgery), I get to make characters that may not look like me, but are still men
  that I find cool, aesthetically appealing, or attractive. In BG3 you can also choose
  genitals like I said, and romance characters, and as a gay trans man, I enjoyed
  being able to play a male character with female genitalia and romance a cis man
  - it made me feel less uncomfortable about navigating the dating field and always
  feeling unseen. I love the BG3 character customization (I think it has some places
  it could improve - like adding plus-sized characters, etc), and it just makes me
  happy to know that I can play a cis man, trans man, cis woman, trans woman, or even
  a nonbinary character! Character creation allowed me to explore my gender before
  coming out, and now that I have it allows me to affirm that gender identity and
  (in Baldur's Gate's case) allows me to also affirm my sexuality!"
alt_text: '"This avatar is a tall, muscular orcish character with gray skin, pointed
  ears, sharp lower teeth, and short red hair. He is wearing a set of leather armor
  with metal gauntlets and a flaming sword."'
