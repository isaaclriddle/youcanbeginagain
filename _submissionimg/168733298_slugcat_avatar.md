game: Stardew Valley. Designed by Eric Barone. ConcernedApe. 2016. PlayStation 4.
why_this_game: '"I mostly play Stardew Valley with my friends. I don''t play games
  with character creation. I play more games where you don''t get to choose who you
  play as."'
avatar_relationship: '"I feel this kind of game gives people a judgment-free outlet
  to explore gender identity. Your appearance in the game doesn''t affect the gameplay
  other than your own experience playing as something you created. Whether the character
  created is something that represents you or just some silly person you made, it
  allows for a connection to really immerse you into a game."'
alt_text: "\"There are three avatars present in a pixelated style. The one on top
  is dark-skinned with short and straight purple hair and a purple shirt. The second
  one is light-skinned with short and straight purple-brown hair and a green shirt.
  The third one has black sunglasses, light-skin, and short and straight center-parted
  hair that is purple; they are wearing a white shirt with blue overalls.\"\r\n"
