game: Stardew Valley. Designed by Eric Barone. ConcernedApe. 2016. PlayStation 4.
avatar_pronouns: He/Him
why_this_game: '"I mostly play Stardew Valley with my friends. I don''t play games
  with character creation. I play more games where you don''t get to choose who you
  play as."'
avatar_relationship: ' "I feel this kind of game gives people a judgment-free outlet
  to explore gender identity. Your appearance in the game does not affect the gameplay
  other than your own experience playing as something you created. Whether the character
  created is something that represents you or just some silly person you made, it
  allows for a connection to really immerse you into a game." '
