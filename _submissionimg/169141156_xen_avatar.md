game: Minecraft. Mojang Studios. 2009. Windows PC.
avatar_pronouns: He/Him
why_this_game: '"Because I play Minecraft the most out of any other video game, and
  out of the games I consistently play it has the most variable character creation
  function."'
avatar_relationship: '"I think it can be a really critical way to engage in exploration
  with your self-expression, particularly in an environment where there is no judgement
  from anyone around you - in a society that''s becoming increasingly transphobic
  and homophobic, these avenues are vital for the continuation of the trans community.
  Gender is also impacted by SO much within your own life that it''s even better when
  games allow you to put aspects of your personality (interests, likes, dislikes,
  etc) to really understand how you and your identity interact with the world."'
