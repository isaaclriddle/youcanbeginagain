game: Cyberpunk 2077. CD Projekt Red. 2022. Xbox Series X.
avatar_pronouns: They/Them
why_this_game: '"Its my favorite game besides marvel rivals and I think Cyberpunk
  is a good example of a game that tried to make trans representation and failed spectacularly."'
avatar_relationship: '"I try to make my characters similar to me in gender and sexuality
  (AFAB trans nonbinary and preference for fem and nonbinary partners). This character
  I had to make a female presentation and voice to get Judy (a lesbian NPC) as a love
  interest. If I had more autonomy with this or mods I would''ve made them more neutral.
  I gave them no visible genitals or nipples similar to my own transition goals but
  I would''ve preferred to not have a chest. I''m actually getting top surgery in
  real life next year. Also their hair is purple and in space buns which is my favorite
  color/style but I prefer my hair shorter and more androgynous in real life. It''s
  kind of like playing as a more feminine version of myself that I would be more comfortable
  expressing if people didn''t constantly misgender me in real life."'
