game: Cyberpunk 2077. CD Projekt Red. 2022. Xbox Series X.
why_this_game: '"Its my favorite game besides marvel rivals and I think Cyberpunk
  is a good example of a game that tried to make trans representation and failed spectacularly."'
avatar_relationship: '"I try to make my characters similar to me in gender and sexuality
  (AFAB trans nonbinary and preference for fem and nonbinary partners). This character
  I had to make a female presentation and voice to get Judy (a lesbian NPC) as a love
  interest. If I had more autonomy with this or mods I would''ve made them more neutral.
  I gave them no visible genitals or nipples similar to my own transition goals but
  I would''ve preferred to not have a chest. I''m actually getting top surgery in
  real life next year. Also their hair is purple and in space buns which is my favorite
  color/style but I prefer my hair shorter and more androgynous in real life. It''s
  kind of like playing as a more feminine version of myself that I would be more comfortable
  expressing if people didn''t constantly misgender me in real life."'
alt_text: '"This avatar has long neon purple hair in two space buns atop their head,
  and long, thick bangs across their forehead and framing their face. Their skin is
  tan, they have a silver hoop nose ring, and underneath their black eyes they have
  silver cybernetics. They are dressed in a silver suit with a black undershirt and
  pink accents, and in the image they are looking at themsevlves in the mirror."'
