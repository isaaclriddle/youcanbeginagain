why_this_game: '"BG3 is one of my favorite games to create characters in because the
  character creator has so many options, and the character you''re playing directly
  impacts story choices and game-play. When I first started playing the game, I restarted
  multiple times just to make new characters and see what changed in-game based on
  that. It also helps that BG3 has a lot of options for gender expression in terms
  of voice, body type, genitals, and more. Over time, I have played many different
  characters with different gender expressions."'
avatar_relationship: '"Character creation for me has been both a way to express my
  own gender identity and a way to explore other gender expressions, even if they
  aren''t what I strictly identify with. Though I personally identify as transmasc
  and use he/him pronouns, my characters in BG3 usually fall into she/they, he/they,
  and they/them territory with any combination of masculine and feminine features.
  I think the only common trait shared by my BG3 characters is that none of them really
  conform to a binary gender. Since the game lets you mix and match physical characteristics,
  voice types, and clothes, I don''t think I have made any characters that could be
  identified as a cisgender man or woman. Essentially, there''s always some kind of
  gender fuckery going on. Perhaps this is a reflection of my own personal resistance
  to identify with a binary gender. In other games that don''t have the same level
  of customization, I usually create masculine female characters or feminine male
  characters based on clothing options/names. I just think playing gender-non-conforming
  characters is neat."'
