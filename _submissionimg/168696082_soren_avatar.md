why_this_game: BG3 is one of my favorite games to create characters in because the
  character creator has so many options, and the character you're playing directly
  impacts story choices and game-play. When I first started playing the game, I restarted
  multiple times just to make new characters and see what changed in-game based on
  that. It also helps that BG3 has a lot of options for gender expression in terms
  of voice, body type, genitals, and more. Over time, I have played many different
  characters with different gender expressions.
avatar_relationship: Character creation for me has been both a way to express my own
  gender identity and a way to explore other gender expressions, even if they aren't
  what I strictly identify with. Though I personally identify as transmasc and use
  he/him pronouns, my characters in BG3 usually fall into she/they, he/they, and they/them
  territory with any combination of masculine and feminine features. I think the only
  common trait shared by my BG3 characters is that none of them really conform to
  a binary gender. Since the game lets you mix and match physical characteristics,
  voice types, and clothes, I don't think I have made any characters that could be
  identified as a cisgender man or woman. Essentially, there's always some kind of
  gender fuckery going on. Perhaps this is a reflection of my own personal resistance
  to identify with a binary gender. In other games that don't have the same level
  of customization, I usually create masculine female characters or feminine male
  characters based on clothing options/names. I just think playing gender-non-conforming
  characters is neat.
