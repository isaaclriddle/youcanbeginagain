game: Baldur's Gate III. Larian Studios. 2023. Windows PC.
why_this_game: '"Well.... To be honest, Baldur''s Gate 3 wasn''t my first choice -
  that character is my 3rd-most (hah) self-identifying character. My first choice
  would be the avatar that I made for VRChat, then for FFXIV. However, those games
  aren''t quite singleplayer now are they? This Baldur''s Gate 3 character is still
  good to use though! She is based on my VRChat avatar (who is based on me)."'
avatar_relationship: '"She is quite literally me with a few edits to personal preference,
  like the more purple-ish hue to hair. For me, player-made avatars go beyond self-affirmation
  and head towards the territory of embodiment in the game. You know, like how it''s
  supposed to be for cisgender folks."'
alt_text: '"This avatar is dark-skinned with short and straight black hair, long light
  green and red wizard-like robes, and is holding a wooden staff."'
