why_this_game: It's a multiplayer roleplaying game and I find it a lot of fun.
avatar_relationship: For RP games, I don't feel like my characters need to reflect
  my own gender identity since I'm doing a bit; but I still end up usually playing
  guys and/or gender diverse characters in some form. Before figuring myself out,
  I would often try playing as a girl (either because there was more customization
  available or I felt it was what I 'had to do' because I was stuck being one IRL.)
  Later on as my egg cracked I started playing guys in character-creator games more,
  and that is what I usually do now. I'll play as a guy if it's representing me, and
  if it's a separate character they're likely still masculine. I think making chars.
  in singleplayer games (and in general through RP/etc) lets you explore aspects of
  yourself or things like that that you don't get to (or shouldn't) do in real life
  (like making an evil char etc), but also often reflects a bit of yourself in them.
  Since all gender is a sort of performance, having a character perform it in a game
  definitely lets you explore stuff.
