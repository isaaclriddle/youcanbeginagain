game: Baldur's Gate III. Larian Studios. 2023. Windows PC.
why_this_game: There are admittedly not many games with diverse character creation
  available. My other choices were Cyberpunk 2077 (which doesn't have a nonbinary
  option and has streamlined romance options based on your combination of sex and
  gender) and Mass Effect (which forces you into a binary with less freedom with character
  design- which I don't blame considering how old it is). Baldur's Gate 3 made me
  feel able to make my character my own. I could give them any voice, body type, and
  genitals without feeling forced by the game to make certain choices, especially
  when it came to romance.
avatar_relationship: My gender identity is up in the air. Mostly, I feel Agender and
  don't necessarily care how I'm addressed. Sometimes I feel nonbinary and would prefer
  to be addressed as they/them. However, I don't feel comfortable expressing my preferred
  identity in real life, so just default to my birth sex since that's easier. In video
  games, however, I can become whoever I want. Since I prefer single player games,
  I especially feel able to be myself without judgement. The characters I make tend
  to have a mixture of feminine and masculine traits, which is usually only possible
  with diverse character creators. The character I submitted is male with a masculine
  voice, but has a more feminine body. It's similar to how I myself am female in body,
  but don't particularly mentally connect with being a woman. Character creators have
  allowed me to explore how I see myself and how I want to be seen by others. Some
  of the first character creators I encountered were in text-based interactive fiction
  games (e.g. Choice of Games LLC) where there are no visuals, you just state your
  gender and appearance. Going from that form of mentally envisioning my character
  to games like Baldur's Gate 3 that let me physically see them has helped me feel
  more comfortable with myself. Even if the world would find me strange, I have a
  sense of internal acceptance where I know it's okay to not fit into what someone
  expects of me.
alt_text: This avatar is a tiefling, which is a demonic creature with two long horns
  and a pointed tail, and have soft pink skin. His eyes are black and shadowed in
  black eyeshadow, and they have ink-like lines swirling around the skin of their
  face and neck. His hair is long and light blonde, and is tied back in a ponytail
  He is dressed in red and brown leather armor, which lies underneath a silver chestplate
  with gold accents and matching silver gauntlets. There is a sword strapped to his
  back with a metal handle with a glowing gold jewel on the end.
