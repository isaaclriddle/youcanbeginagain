game: 'Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete. Developed by Nintendo Cube. Nintendo.
  2017. iOS.'
why_this_game: '"Animal Crossing is one of the few games where I play as myself instead
  of as somebody else."'
avatar_relationship: '"I used Animal Crossing (though New Horizons, not Pocket Camp)
  at the beginning of my transition to experiment with my personal sense of style
  (different hair cuts and colors, different clothing options, etc.). It''s a game
  that encourages you to play as yourself and identify with your character. In other
  single-player games with character creators that I play, like Stardew Valley or
  No Man''s Sky (both of those have multiplayer modes but I play them in singleplayer),
  I do usually make characters with the same gender identity as myself (male), and
  with styles that I find appealing, but they are other people and I give them different
  names and motivations. I use them to explore gender as well, but in more of a fantasy
  context (I can be a badass masculine fighter in those games, or an angel with wings,
  or I particularly like playing No Man''s Sky as a Construct who has to build himself
  from scratch as an allegory for building my own life as a trans person), whereas
  I keep my Animal Crossing outfits realistic to things I might actually wear."'
alt_text: '"This avatar has light skin and short and straight brown hair. He is wearing
  a black baseball cap, a long-sleeved sweater over a collared shirt, and has black
  glasses. He is holding a donut in one hand."'
