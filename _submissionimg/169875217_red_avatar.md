why_this_game: '"Stardew is really the only game I play consistently."'
avatar_relationship: '"I am a trans male (FTM) so when I create a character in a video
  game, I want them to represent how i see myself irl. I chose a male character and
  dressed him in a simple striped shirt and shorts, since this is something I would
  also wearl irl. I also decided to add items to my character that aren''t realistic,
  such a duck beak and a party hat. Neither of these are things i have lol but I feel
  like it still speaks to my gender identity. The duck beak makes my character inhuman
  in a way, but this is also how I see myself due to gender and identity as an autistic
  person."'
