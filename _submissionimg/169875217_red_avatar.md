game: Stardew Valley. Designed by Eric Barone. ConcernedApe. 2016. PlayStation 4.
why_this_game: Stardew is really the only game I play consistently.
avatar_relationship: I am a trans male (FTM) so when I create a character in a video
  game, I want them to represent how i see myself irl. I chose a male character and
  dressed him in a simple striped shirt and shorts, since this is something I would
  also wearl irl. I also decided to add items to my character that aren't realistic,
  such a duck beak and a party hat. Neither of these are things i have lol but I feel
  like it still speaks to my gender identity. The duck beak makes my character inhuman
  in a way, but this is also how I see myself due to gender and identity as an autistic
  person.
alt_text: This avatar is in a pixelated style and has light skin, brown eyes, and
  short brown hair. He is wearing a set of denim overalls with a white t-shirt beneath
  it, and a roasted chicken hat on his head that obscures most of his face except
  for his eyes and his fringe.
